# Elgato-Control-Center-Backend
This repository stores the backend related functionality for interacting with Elgato products for the Elgato Control Center application.  The backend core functionality will control Elgatos lighting products for streamers and content creators.

# Purpose of the project / repository
The purpose of this project is to develop the Elagto Control Center functionality for the GNU / Linux operating system, specifically the back-end functionality of the 
project.The project will serve well as part of the Elgato-Control-Center project. Also, the project will provide a independent project where we can develop the back-end functionality independently from the main Elgato-Control-Center project repository, which provides an opportunity to build a custom back-end library for the Elgato-Control-Center project.

Their is options to use existing Python libraries to serve as the projects back-end functionality however, the issue with using existing third party libraries is that the back-end functionality will be harder to maintain and release any new updates to introduce, enhance or resolve any issues with the back-end code. Also, a lot of the third party libraries are no longer maintained and feel I can simplify the back-end code further to make it more maintainable and at the same time modernise the projects back-end source code.
